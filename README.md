Write me (P8) 

The extraction of information elements from unstructured text is a widely addressed research problem in the field of text mining. E-mail and chat messages are characterized not only by a partially structured form, which includes - for example - fixed formulas and metadas, but also by a dialogical and dynamic nature. Following these considerations, the research project could approach the problem of extracting information content from e-mail message texts on three different levels, not necessarily all mandatory:

Structural elements: Extract the formal elements of the single e-mail messages, such as the pleasantries and the signature, but also themes and topics.

Non-structural elements: All the elements that are expected in an email but are not structural, such as arguments. The problem of argument mining in particular has received and continues to receive great attention in the scientific literature.

Dialogues: Extension of the previous tasks to a dialogical environment, such as a chat.

Dataset: Enron Email Data, Hillary Clinton Emails, Apache Email Archives, NPS CHat Corpus, Fraudulent E-mail Corpus.
